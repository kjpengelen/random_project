                The case file of Rayid Ghani on predicting auction prices is based on an article from the Financial Times (Thomas, 2006) where Daniel Thomas interviewed Rayid Ghani on his paper “Predicting the End-Price of Online Auctions” (Ghani & Simmons, 2004). Ghani was at the time employed at Accenture’s Information Technology Group as a researcher.<br><br>
                Ghani and Simmons created and applied a method of mining sales-data from eBay auctions in order to predict the end-prices of auctioned products; PDA’s in the case of Ghani and Simmons. The algorithm bases a prospective price on characteristics of the seller, information about the product being sold, and past sales information about similar products.<br><br>
                An algorithm that predicts sales-prices could end up being useful for insurance companies and online auction companies. In turn, these companies can offer sellers an insurance so they will be able to receive their desired price for the product. The insurance works as follows: the seller pays a fee to the insurer. When the sale doesn’t reach the agreed price, they receive the price difference from the insurance company.<br><br>
                On the other hand, the data mining tool can also be used to offer sellers information on how to present their product on eBay. It can offer them guidelines on how they can get the most out of their deal.

              <p class="text-muted mb-0 text-left">
                People who auction something want to receive the best price for their products. With a Super Crunching auction data algorithm you can predict when it is the best time to sell. Or, as a buyer, what the best moment is to buy a product. As an insurance company guarantees a selling price and pays the difference when the product is sold for less, it seems like all parties end up as winners.<br><br>
                The general question that is being discussed is whether a prediction of a price and a confidence score is viable for an insurance company to invest in. Accenture estimated that they could have made $87,000 monthly revenue if they offered insurance for PDA sales during their testing period (Thomas, 2006). However, the end-price-insurance hasn’t become common practice in the past decade. What is holding back this development? Is the strength and development of an algorithm falling short? Or do the sellers lack trust in the insurance product?

                  The video below explains how Kyle MacDonald used his trading skills to swap a simple invaluable object into a substantial asset. It illustrates how objects don’t have a fix value but that an objects value can vary over situations and time. A smart trader is therefore able to make profit due to these sales margins.

                The above clip shows Kyle MacDonald's achievement and tells of how it’s possible to make money by trading. This might also have motivated scientists to unravel the secrets of a good trade. Ghani and his team created the algorithm for predicting the end-price while he was employed at the IT consultancy company Accenture. The goal was to remove the uncertainty for a seller by foreseeing the outcome of an auction. The real life problem here is that an auction by itself brings uncertainties to both the buyer and the seller of the auctioned item. If you can create a model that can deal with or take away these uncertainties, both parties could be better off.

          <p><strong>Scientific rationale</strong></p>
          <p>
            The scientific rationale that the paper by Ghani and Simmons (2004) draws on is grounded in machine learning or more specifically computational learning theory. This theory was developed in the artificial intelligence community in order to provide a formal framework in which questions regarding the performance of the machine algorithm can be precisely formulated (Goldman, 1997). The use of this framework allows scientists to make meaningful comparisons between different machine learning algorithms in order to assess which algorithms have superior performances. As a result, it has become possible for scientists to apply machine learning to solve problems which would normally require human intelligence to do so.<br><br>
            The problem in the case of Ghani and Simmons (2004) is the prediction of end prices of online auctions using data acquired from Ebay. Their prediction model draws on several features as input variables in order to compute the output variable, which is the end price. Many of these features are dynamic as a result of items being auctioned over time. For example, whether the auction is close or not to its ending or what and when the previous bids were influence the end price of the auction. The prediction therefore falls under the rule of Bayes’ Theorem. This rule describes that the probability that an event occurs is related to events that happened prior to that event. In case of the auction price, it may be more likely that the auction price will change to a different predicted variable if the price that was predicted initially is starting to look unrealistic based on the input data at that point in time.  Machine learning is used to tackle the problem in 3 different ways.<br>
          </p>

          <p><i>Regression</i></p>
          <p>
            In this case the features that were extracted from the auction listing are used as covariates and machine learning is subsequently used to learn the regression coefficients.
          </p>

          <p><i>Multi class classification</i></p>
          <p>
            In this case, the data is used to put each auction into a certain category. Auctions that score similarly on certain features are grouped together for prediction of their end price. The result is that while prediction of the end-price become less exact, the learning process is enhanced. The tools used for this prediction method are decision trees and neural networks.<br>
          </p>

          <p><i>Multiple binary classification tasks</i></p>
          <p>
            In this case, the input variables are assigned the value 1 or 0 based on whether they hold true for a specific value (i.e. item is new (1) or not new (0)). The idea behind this classification is that for a significant number of individual items, there is often not a large amount of data available. In addition, the notion that an item is sealed or not sealed for example is non quantifiable data, yet it is useful information to predict the end price. Converting such information to a binary value enhances the machine learning capabilities.

          <p><strong>Explaining and Forecasting Online Auction Prices and Their Dynamics Using Functional Data Analysis</strong></p>
          <p>
            Wang, Jank, and Shmueli (2008) appreciate the potential of predicting online auction prices. However, they stress that the dynamics of the bidding process have mostly been left ignored up until that point. Generally, the work has focused around statically predicting the final price of an auction based on information that does not change throughout an auction, such as the opening bid, seller ranking or item value.<br><br>
            However, it may be beneficial to be able to update predictions based on developments that occur throughout an auction. Also, functional data methodology for modeling temporal bidding information. The prospected benefit is that this can help bidders determine which items currently being auctioned are most likely to end up being the cheapest. This is especially useful for common and popular items where there often are multiple comparable items up for sale. On the other side of the auction, insurance companies are already able to offer sellers a guaranteed profit, in return for a small fee, based on static information about the auction, to take away some insecurity about the sale. However, by predicting auction dynamically they could offer sellers a ‘buy-it-now’ insurance, based on current auction developments.<br><br>
            To develop such a model of auction sales, they developed a dynamic forecasting model. This can predict the final price based on current bidding dynamics in the bidding process. Aside from using static auction variables, it can also incorporate time-dependent variables such as current number of bidders and current average bidder reputation which may all be of use.<br>
          </p>

          <p><strong>Functional Data Analysis</strong></p>
          <p>
            The model is based on functional data analysis (FDA). Traditional data methods assume data arrive at evenly spaced intervals. However, this is not true for the bidding process, where bidding happens erratically. Furthermore, auctions have heterogeneous price dynamics. FDA assumes data are functional observations, such as curves, shapes or objects. This conflicts with the events of online auctions, because the progression of bids is a discrete phenomenon. To solve this, the researchers assume there is an underlying price curve, that guides the actual bids. This curve is found by applying smoothing (penalized smoothing pline) to the auction bids.
          </p>

          <p><strong>Predicting auctions</strong></p>
          <p>
            They looked at bid histories for an Xbox and a Harry Potter book (high and low value products, respectively).
          </p>

          <p><i>Mechanism design</i></p>
          <p>
            Higher opening bids led to higher prices. This was already known, but now it can be shown that this holds all the way through the auction. However, they decrease price velocity at the end, because the price has already been inflated. Reserve bidding has similar effects as a high opening bid.
          </p>

          <p><i>Seller characteristics</i></p>
          <p>
            Seller rating has positive effect on final prices and final price increase. Lower prices throughout the rest.
          </p>

          <p><i>Item characteristics</i></p>
          <p>
            New products, as opposed to used ones, sell for an overall higher price, but towards the end of auctions, used products increase faster in price. Item value obviously leads to a higher price throughout, but towards the end, lower-value items have stronger price increases.
          </p>

          <p><i>Bidding characteristics</i></p>
          <p>
            The current number of bids mostly just increases prices in the beginning. Auctions with lots of early bidding have higher bidding dynamics at first, but a slower price increase. Later, this behavior is reversed. Jump bidding (bids 30% higher than the previous bid) has highest impact at the end of the curve. Highly rated bidders bid early, then slow down, but then catch up again at the end of the auction.<br><br>
            Wang et al. (2008) admit that bidders have the possibility to check other auctions as well, but did not incorporate this yet. These may also influence prices. Especially in the case of popular and common items.

          <p><strong>Concurrent online auction data and their visualization</strong></p>
          <p class="text-left">
            Previous studies showed how different machine learning algorithms predict independent online auctions. However, online auctions have typical characteristics which influence the overall selling process, including the final selling price. For one, online auctions have no geographical barriers, which increases the both the supply, as well as the demand for a specific product. Moreover, online auctions have varying time period, where one auctions lasts only a couple of hours, where another lasts for several days. Due to these properties, online auctions can occur simultaneously, and buyers are given the possibility to bid on similar or competing items. As a result, these different items will influence each other’s final selling price. This concurrent structure of online auctions make it an interesting topic to study.<br><br>
            Hyde, Jank, and Shmueli (2006) study how concurrency influences a product’s final price but also focus on visualization methods that better display the simultaneous ongoing auctions.<br><br>
            Hyde et al. used data from 236 closed auctions for a PDA. This data consisted of bidding history and auction features (e.g. duration, item category). Final prices can be influenced negatively or positively by: whether or not the box was already opened, a questionable seller reputation, a special accessory added to the sale or free shipping. <br>
            According to Shmueli, Russo, and Jank (2004), a typical pattern of bidding activity in online auctions start off with some bidding activity at the beginning, followed by a period of little activity, and concluding with a growth of bids at the end. But using this pattern to predict future auctions is not adequate enough. Hyde et al. (2006) propose several methods to analyze and visualize price dynamics.<br>
          </p>
          <i>Rug plots</i>
          <p>
            The first goal for Hyde et al. (2006) was to visualize the price evolution of a set of auctions. This should allow them to inspect for similarities and patterns in these auctions price evolutions. They propose a graphical method that displays an auctions price-evolution against time. Figure 1 illustrates this in a so-called rug plot of 236 different auctions. The black dots represent the end-price of a single auction. Additionally, Hyde et al. also look at a price-velocity curve, which is the first derivative of the price-evolution curve to illustrate the change difference over time (Figure 2).

          </figure>

          <p>
            As these type of plots maintain temporal information of several auctions, it’s suitable for analyzing the concurrency of auctions. Doing so offers certain types of patterns which represent the temporal concurrency.<br><br>
            One of the typical patterns that can be deduced from the graphs is the behavior of sniping. This behavior leads to a high bidding frequencies at the end of the auction and to high peaks in the at the end of the price-velocity curve.<br><br>
            Hyde et al. describe three main shapes of price curves: j-shaped (sniping), s-shaped and a straight line. A j-shaped curve starts when opening bids are low ($0.01). Straight lines occur when opening bids are already quite high, which result in little bidding. The s-shaped curve occurs when bidders increase strongly halfway through the auction. By color coding the curves, it’s possible to investigated different types of groupings, like number of bidders and auction duration for example. When doing this for auction duration, it’s appears that some auction durations have tendency to group together (3 or 5-day auctions). <br>
          </p>

          <i>Time Grouped Box Plots</i>
          <p>
            Besides looking at price-evolution curves, Shmueli and Jank (2005) proposed using boxplots to incorporate the volume of auctions for a specific series of time windows. Analysis in this manner shows that the median of weekly closing prices over time. Whereas closing prices on daily basis might vary a lot. When analyzing auction volumes on a daily scale, it becomes clear that most auctions take place during only one half of the day.
          </p>

          <i>Moving Statistics Plots</i>
          <p>
            A third useful method in visualizing auction data is by plotting the combined average or median over time. The statistic is computed over a cohort of closing bids. Figure 3 shows these plots for cohorts of three, five and ten closing bids. This so called moving statistics plot is useful for understanding time-trends and offers a smoother transition over time.<br><br>
            As concurrency seems to influence online auctions, the above mentioned methods to visualize the data prove to be valuable tools to understand a seller’s market better.

          <p><strong>A Proficient and Dynamic Bidding Agent for Online Auctions</strong></p>
          <p>
            Ghani and Simmons (2004) proposed a machine learning based approach to predict end-prices of auctions. This can apply in for instance ‘price insurance’ in an auction, as explained earlier. Moreover, the predicted end price can be used for sellers to auction their products for the optimal price. Kaur, Goyal, and Lu (2012) present another application of this machine learning in the form of an “automated dynamic bidding agent” (ADBA). They again stress the difficulty of making decisions in auctions, such as analyzing items, selecting and making bids. An automated agent can help a seller or a buyer in an auction, according to the authors.<br><br>
          </p>
          <p>
            The agent proposed by Kaur et al. (2012) uses strategies comparable with previous literature. For price estimation, historical data is analyzed and similar auctions are clustered based on characteristics as average bid amount, average bid rate, number of bids. After bid mapping and selection, the initial price is estimated, also taking current bids into account. Then, the bid forecaster classifies bidders’ behavior based on Figure 4.
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center figure">
            <img src="img/figures/kaur_a.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
            <figcaption class="">Figure 4</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            It models the bid amount for the strategy of the bidders. This can consist of several strategies: mystical bidding strategy, sturdy bidding strategy, desperate bidding strategy and strategic bidding strategy.<br><br>
            The mystical bidder places one bid in the last period of the auction, based on the current competition. The sturdy bidder does the same, yet earlier. A desperate bidder bids multiple times in the last hour of the auction. The strategic bidder does the same, but more slowly, and they start with an amount closer to their reservation price. <br><br>
            As this agent considers different behaviors of buyers, it can give better predictions than other literature’s methods. Moreover, an automated agent can be of use for people that do not want to spend too much time on bidding.<br><br>

          <p><strong>A Comparison of Bidding Strategies for Online Auctions using Fuzzy Reasoning and Negotiation Decision Functions</strong></p>
          <p>
            Kayer, Goyal, and Lu (2017) continued their research on bidding strategies for online auctions and an agent in this more recent paper. They emphasize that for designing online auction mechanisms, software agents have emerged to be essential for online auction environments. Since these agents use a systematic approach, they outperform humans in complex decision-making situations.<br><br>
            Further on they argue that with the prediction of an end price, a buyer can create an optimal buying strategy for him/herself.<br><br>
            The authors extend their own model by adding the same two options underneath all three of the Mystical, Sturdy and Strategic bidders. Namely, Ambitious and Sophisticated bidders, as seen in Figure 5.<br>
          </p>

          <figure class="text-center figure">
            <img src="img/figures/kaur_b.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded">
            <figcaption class="">Figure 5</figcaption>
          </figure>

          <p>
            The Ambitious bidder is desperate for the win, while the Sophisticated bidder maybe wants to bargain for the deal. All characteristics of the different buyers as well as their bidding history within the experiment are taken into account.<br><br>
            Fuzzy Reasoning and Negotiation Decision Functions (NDF) were the two methods used to model the agents. For both methods, parameters were set for the different types of bidders.  Afterwards the two methods were compared, where the Fuzzy agent outperforms the NDF agent on most setting in both success and utility.

          Predicting the end price in an auction seems to be a very useful and important field. In 2005, the time Ghani and Simmons wrote their paper, they specified that online marketplaces had been gaining importance. Recently, Kerstenbaum (2017) stated that there are still a lot of online marketplaces and that the concept is in some ways better than regular stores. This indicates that it is still significantly used and thus research about it is valuable.<br><br>
          Ghani and Simmons were one of the first to explore super crunching in this subject in 2005. The case seems to have had a small significant impact, as it is cited 59 times. Yet only from 2018 onwards, there are a lot of articles with the same topic, which shows that it is still interesting. The whole existing literature about it is quite large. The methods that were used in the original case are still accepted, yet there are also other data mining methods in the field now. As discussed in the paper summary section, some used clustering to analyze historical data, others used functional data analysis. Multiple people seem to test different ways to predict auction prices and they have their own theories about how you should best perform in an auction. The case itself may not have had an enormous impact, but the subject definitely triggered others to do similar work or expand on the theories.<br><br>
          Non-scientific literature is mostly about the insurance concept, which we will talk about later on.<br><br>
          Currently, as still different data mining techniques are being tested to predict auction prices, probably one of the biggest scientific questions right now is what the best way of data mining is.

              The different algorithms mentioned in the paper of Ghani & Simmons (2005) but not mentioned in the Financial Times article (Thomas, 2006) for predicting end prices of PDA’s have an accuracy up to 96%. Already in the Financial Times article, some critique is given by Forrester Research analyst Hellen Omwando (Thomas, 2006), doubting the possibility to correctly predict prices of goods like antiques and services. However, Ghani already confirmed in his paper that the current predicting model needs an extension to be applicable for “soft” goods like antiques and fashion items (Ghani & Simmons, 2005). Moreover, Accenture confirms the model’s poor applicability for goods with little historic auction data in the Financial Times article.<br><br>
              Apart from the fact that the algorithm is not applicable to all type of goods. Other reasons might also have blocked the introduction of sales-insurance. As the algorithm combines a lot of information about human decision making as a group, it doesn’t consider the decision maker of a seller. As these algorithms attempt to guarantee the final end-price of an auction, it can’t guarantee the price that a sellers wants to receive for the sale. For online auctions, end-prices usually end up lower than a user’s desired price. Because of this, the algorithm isn’t used to offer insurance, it’s more a reality check that offers forehanded disappointment about the end-price. Consequently, this could be a reason why it’s not being implemented: sellers don’t agree with so they won’t use the insurance, or even worse, scare them away from eBay.<br><br>
              As well as offering insurance, the proposed algorithm can also offer sellers insight in how to improve the features of their advertisements. By tweaking the features, auction sites can offer users a way to increase their end-price value. However, when algorithms start offering sellers insight in how to best sell their product, this will affect the market. For example, if a seller plans to sell their ice skates in June, and eBay suggests to wait until December to sell, this probably result in everybody selling their ice skates during the winter period. As a result, this will influence the sellers market as there will be a peak in supply. In such case, the end-price is not predictable anymore by an algorithm, as the end-price is also influenced by the algorithms prediction.

              We did not come across any instance of these models being implemented outside of research. Neither do we see online auction sites give sellers and buyers sales price prediction, nor do we see the websites or third parties offering sales insurance, in the way Ghani & Simmons (2004) predicted. In this section we detail what may have hampered the development, but we also look at what progress has been made.<br><br>
              In the example it is mentioned that previous analyses of auction prices were somewhat lacking. Earlier studies were focused on merely analyzing previous actions and not building prediction models. There had been 2 studies which yielded more concrete results, with one study by Bajari & Hortascu (2003) mentioning econometric techniques which could help predict bidding behavior and a study by Lucking-Reiley, Bryan, Prasad, and Reeves (2007) which used Ebay data to study factors that affect price. The former article was limited in providing knowledge for prediction model-building purposes for its lack of features (predictor variables) while the latter article only identified factors of notice and did not apply them in an empirical setting. Rayid Ghani overcame the limitations of these earlier studies, by integrating features and modelling techniques to make the model explicit.<br><br>
              Predicting prices for rare goods such as antiques is still a problem, but continued research on predicting auction prices has yielded other improvements in the field. Hyde et al. (2006) made progress on visualizing auctions, giving insights into the bidding process. Wang et al. (2008) then introduced a model that could predict auction prices ‘live’, using information about the auction as it takes place. This mostly offers opportunities for buyers looking for the best deals on common items, such as phones or books. This development in turn paved the way for Kaur et al. (2012) to start developing bots that can do the bidding for buyers, and find the best deal.<br><br>
              One of the main uses for predicting auction prices mentioned by Ghani is that third-party can offer price insurance to sellers. When a predicted auction price is known, the insurer can calculate how high the risk is that they have to compensate for an unfavorable auction outcome. The actual use of such price insurance for sellers has since then seen little concrete use.<br><br>
              The idea of insuring online auctions using computational algorithms was patented several years after publishing the paper (Ghani, 2010). Patents offer security for companies to engage in R&D, as they prevent others parties from freely making use of their investments. However, this makes feasibly implementing such systems much harder for other parties, such as online auction websites themselves or other insurance companies.<br><br>
              There are, however, some documented insurance policies for auctions made available by third parties. They insure buyers in case they buy a product that turns out to be damaged, broken or in some other way does not give the quality expected for the price. These type of insurances are especially used for car auctions, which have entire companies surrounding this business practice, such as the American Insurance Auto Auction Inc. or the British Auction Insurance Agency. In such auctions it is a common occurrence that people buy a car which has operational issues or is a stolen vehicle. A distinct difference with this type of insurance and the type of insurance Ghani proposes is that in such cases, the buyer is insured instead of the seller.<br><br>
              One of the main reasons the buyer is more likely to buy insurance is that once the auction ends, the buyer cannot undo his bid. In contrast, the seller often has the choice to decline selling the item if the highest bid is deemed unsatisfactory. Therefore, the sellers are already insured through being given the opportunity to evaluate the highest offer with their own demands. However, in situations where the sellers needs to sell an item with time constraints, due to moving homes, being in need of money, or otherwise, then simply waiting for a deal meeting the seller’s minimum requirements is not an option. In such a scenario buying a selling insurance could still be advantageous.
